  Background:
</h2>
<p>
  	Khaos grew up being more than a little aggressive, eventually going full-fledged bully in highschool with one of her main victims being Lo-carb. At some point at the end of her senior year, the sight of cuts on another victim’s arms made her realize that what she was doing was having lasting effects, and isolated herself from everyone else, even feigning sickness to avoid going in front of everyone during graduation, seeing herself as a monster. 
</p>
<p>
    After a little over a year of isolation and self-deprecation, she decided to reinvent herself. Being brighter, more cheerful, she more or less tried to trick herself into being happier, even picking up RPG games where she could put herself in the place of a hero where she could help people(albeit virtual ones). It’s all still that though: a trick. She’s still very critical about all of her actions, to the point where she thinks she deserves her anxiety and self doubt. This is  hidden from all but her closest friends though; as on the outside she seems excitable, carefree, and all-around fun.
