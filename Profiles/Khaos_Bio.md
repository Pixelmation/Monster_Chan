Personality:
</h2>

<ul>
Very “manic pixie girl” disposition
Seems really chaotic and flirty
Really bubbly and supportive
Uses all of this to hide insecurities
Terrified that her HS transgressions 
Will come back to haunt her
Constantly tries to make it up to herself;
Ignores her own problems to try and help others
Excitement is more or less a mask; struggles with
Thinking she’s still a bad person
</ul>
