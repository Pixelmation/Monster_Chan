<h2>
  Personality: 
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Compassionate and easily excitable</li>
  <li>Sings but is shy about her voice</li>
  <li>Secretly a bit of a masochist</li>
  <li>Suprisingly friendly and helpful</li>
</ul>

<h2>
  Background:She was shy and reserved all throughout high school but has recently started to come out of her shell. She had dealt with a lot of self loathing and anxiety in her formative years so that occasionally comes back to haunt her. She is deeply bonded to her friends Zero Ultra and Rehab and would do anything for them. She loves music and rhythm games. She loves to sing but hides it from everyone because the thought of being at the center of attention makes her nervous.
