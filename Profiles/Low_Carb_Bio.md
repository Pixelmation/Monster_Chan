<h2>
  Background:
</h2>

<p>
  Low-Carb grew up in highschool with Khaos, who made her life miserable. Bullied constantly, she was never able to focus on schoolwork or even a social life, leading her to becoming a bit of a recluse, riddled with anxiety and, later, PTSD. Eventually it simply became too much, and she began cutting her upper arms beginning the summer before senior year, wanting <i>some</i> kind of control, wearing her now trademark flannel to cover them up. Around February, Khaos pinned her arms above her head after cornering her in the bathroom, and her sleeves fell enough for the scars to become visible. Khaos seemed to have a moment of realization, and ran off, rarely to be seen in school again.

  Since Khaos' sudden disappearence, she lived through the rest of highschool still on edge, but less terrified of day-to-day life and, that summer after graduation, finally got therapy and stopped cutting. She started volunteering at the local animal shelter, and fell in love with the animals and caring for them, especially the birds. She got a therapy bird, a cockatiel she named Villa, and got a job at Pawsitively Precious where she recently became co-manager. She's still introverted around people, but she's slowly getting better with her mental disorders.
