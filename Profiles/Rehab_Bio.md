<p>
  Pretty big stoner in high school and got pretty deep into the drug scene bc of depression. She has since grown out of it after graduating, but still hangs out with her old pals who were involved. She's still is a dealer only using occasionally with friends who she trusts deeply. She likes point and click adventures, mostly horror.
