  Background:
</h2>

<p>
  Ever since she was little, Loca has been a people person; and as extroverted and amiable she is, it's gotten her in trouble more than once. Once she got into grade school, she started shirking school work for social gatherings/events/just being around people, and she only really stayed just active in school enough to pass. She's not dumb though; on the contrary, she's actually really quick to pick up information and is a lot smarter than she seems at first. She tends to get a bad rep for her bad grades though, often thought to be dumb especially when combining that and her energetic personality.
</p>

<p>
  Once she reached junior year, she discovered the rave scene and it all went to (good) shit. Every night she could get away with it, She went out and forgot about the rest of the world. For a good few months she would end up missing morning classes from getting blackout drunk, completely baked, or when she felt like having extra fun trying a new drug some lucky dealer offered her. She never allowed herself to get genuinly addicted to anything, taking tolerence breaks fairly often for one thing or another. Her older sisters were worried regardless though, and eventually tried to get her to at least tone it done and graduate. She complied, but her raving never stopped. More recently, she's been trying to get her older sister Vanilla Lite to come out of her shell and enjoy herself, though it hasn't gotten very far.
