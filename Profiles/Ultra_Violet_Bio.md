<h2>
  Personality: Ultra Violet is a quirky girl who is, in all forms but physical, her purple angel devil vampire anime heiress cat fursona. She is pretty peppy and bubbly with a completely fabricated "dark side" where her "magical powers" manifest.

<h2>
  Background: She is deeply immersed in internet furry artist subculture to escape the mundanity of daily life. Feeling that she didn't see herself as meaningful or interesting compared to her peers, she claims to have magical powers. This pushed away a lot of potential friends in high school with the exception of all her online friends. Because of that, she hasn't felt too lonely. She loves RPing and any sort of furry MMORPG. She's looking for an heir to her furry kingdom.
