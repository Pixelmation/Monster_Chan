# Coffee Sisters
- Mean Bean is somewhat Tsundere. If she's mean to you it's because she like hanging around you
- Loca Mocha is a rave girl, very extroverted; go with the flow and energetic. Constantly tries to pull Vanilla out of her shell
- Vanilla Lite is a wallflower, very introverted; meek and anxious. If you hurt her sisters then watch out(IE fluttershy. fuck you it's 		the same)
    

- Absolute Zero is TBD
- Zero Ultra is a full blown stoner. Super chill and friendly, so long as you're chill she'll be your friend
