# Coffee Sisters
### Mean Bean

### Loca Mocha 
* A rave girl, very extroverted; go with the flow and energetic. Constantly tries to pull Vanilla out of her shell.
### Vanilla Lite 
* A wallflower, very introverted; meek and anxious. If you hurt her sisters then watch out(IE fluttershy. fuck you it's the same).
